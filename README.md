# ðŸ“˜ Dictionary using Trie (C++)

A C++ project that implements a **Dictionary** using the **Trie (Prefix Tree)** data structure. This implementation supports **fast insertion**, **search**, **deletion**, and **prefix-based word suggestions** â€” perfect for building features like autocomplete, spell-check, and word filtering.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Insert Word** â€“ Add new words to the dictionary for fast lookup.  
- **Search Word** â€“ Check if a word exists in the dictionary.  
- **Delete Word** â€“ Remove a word from the dictionary if it exists.  
- **Auto-complete** â€“ Get all dictionary words with a given prefix.  
- **Display All Words** â€“ Show all words stored in the Trie.  
- **Sample Test Cases** â€“ Included test code for validating all core functionalities.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The **Trie** data structure stores words character by character in a tree format.
- Each node represents a character and has pointers to its child nodes.
- Efficient for operations involving prefixes, as common prefixes share the same path in the tree.
